abstract: We have demonstrated the capability of spectral multiplexing in multi-distance
  diffractive imaging, enabling the reconstruction of samples with diverse spectral
  responses. While previous methods such as ptychography utilize redundancy in radial
  diffraction data to achieve information multiplexing, they typically require capturing
  a substantial amount of diffraction data. In contrast, our approach effectively
  harnesses the redundancy information in axial diffraction data. This significantly
  reduces the amount of diffraction data required and relaxes the stringent requirements
  on optical path stability.
