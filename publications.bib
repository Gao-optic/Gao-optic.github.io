abstract = {We have demonstrated the capability of spectral multiplexing in multi-distance diffractive imaging, enabling the reconstruction of samples with diverse spectral responses. While previous methods such as ptychography utilize redundancy in radial diffraction data to achieve information multiplexing, they typically require capturing a substantial amount of diffraction data. In contrast, our approach effectively harnesses the redundancy information in axial diffraction data. This significantly reduces the amount of diffraction data required and relaxes the stringent requirements on optical path stability.},
